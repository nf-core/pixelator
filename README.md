## Introduction

**nf-core/pixelator** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for analysis of data from the
Molecular Pixelation (MPX) and Proximity Network (PNA) assays. It takes a samplesheet as input and will process your data
using `pixelator` to produce a PXL file containing single-cell protein abundance and protein interactomics data.

![](./docs/images/nf-core-pixelator-metromap.svg)

Depending on the input data the pipeline will run different steps.

For PNA data, the pipeline will run the following steps:

1. Do quality control checks of input reads and build amplicons ([`pixelator single-cell-pna amplicon`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
2. Create groups of amplicons based on their marker assignments ([`pixelator single-cell-pna demux`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
3. Derive original molecules to use as edge list downstream by error correcting, and counting input amplicons ([`pixelator single-cell-pna collapse`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
4. Compute the components of the graph from the edge list in order to create putative cells ([`pixelator single-cell-pna graph`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
5. Denoise the cell graphs ([`pixelator single-cell-pna denoise`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
6. Analyze the spatial information in the cell graphs ([`pixelator single-cell-pna analysis`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
7. Generate 3D graph layouts for visualization of cells ([`pixelator single-cell-pna layout`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
8. Report generation ([`pixelator single-cell-pna report`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))

For MPX data, the pipeline will run the following steps:

1. Build an amplicons from the input reads ([`pixelator single-cell-mpx amplicon`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
2. Read QC and filtering, correctness of the pixel binding sequence sequences ([`pixelator single-cell-mpx preqc | pixelator adapterqc`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
3. Assign a marker (barcode) to each read ([`pixelator single-cell-mpx demux`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
4. Error correction, duplicate removal, compute read counts ([`pixelator single-cell-mpx collapse`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
5. Compute the components of the graph from the edge list in order to create putative cells ([`pixelator single-cell-mpx graph`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
6. Call and annotate cells ([`pixelator single-cell-mpx annotate`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
7. Analyze the cells for polarization and colocalization ([`pixelator single-cell-mpx analysis`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
8. Generate 3D graph layouts for visualization of cells ([`pixelator single-cell-mpx layout`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))
9. Report generation ([`pixelator single-cell-mpx report`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))

> [!WARNING]
> Since Nextflow 23.07.0-edge, Nextflow no longer mounts the host's home directory when using Apptainer or Singularity.
> This causes issues in some dependencies. As a workaround, you can revert to the old behavior by setting the environment variable
> `NXF_APPTAINER_HOME_MOUNT` or `NXF_SINGULARITY_HOME_MOUNT` to `true` in the machine from which you launch the pipeline.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows (the exact values you need to input depend on the design and panel you are using):

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,sample_alias,condition,design,panel,fastq_1,fastq_2
sample1,s1,control,pna-2,proxiome-immuno-155,sample1_R1_001.fastq.gz,sample1_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

Each row represents a sample and gives the design, a panel file and the input fastq files.

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/pixelator \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> This version of the pipeline does not support conda environments, due to issues with upstream dependencies.
> This means you cannot use the `conda` and `mamba` profiles. Please use `docker` or `singularity` instead.
> We hope to add support for conda environments in the future.

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/pixelator/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/pixelator/parameters).
