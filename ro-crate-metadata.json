It takes a samplesheet as input and will process your data\nusing `pixelator` to produce a PXL file containing single-cell protein abundance and protein interactomics data.\n\n![](./docs/images/nf-core-pixelator-metromap.svg)\n\nDepending on the input data the pipeline will run different steps.\n\nFor PNA data, the pipeline will run the following steps:\n\n1. Do quality control checks of input reads and build amplicons ([`pixelator single-cell-pna amplicon`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))\n2. Create groups of amplicons based on their marker assignments ([`pixelator single-cell-pna demux`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))\n3. Derive original molecules to use as edge list downstream by error correcting, and counting input amplicons ([`pixelator single-cell-pna collapse`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))\n4. Compute the components of the graph from the edge list in order to create putative cells ([`pixelator single-cell-pna graph`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))\n5. Denoise the cell graphs ([`pixelator single-cell-pna denoise`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))\n6. Analyze the spatial information in the cell graphs ([`pixelator single-cell-pna analysis`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))\n7. Generate 3D graph layouts for visualization of cells ([`pixelator single-cell-pna layout`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))\n8. Report generation ([`pixelator single-cell-pna report`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))\n\nFor MPX data, the pipeline will run the following steps:\n\n1. Build an amplicons from the input reads ([`pixelator single-cell-mpx amplicon`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))\n2. Read QC and filtering, correctness of the pixel binding sequence sequences ([`pixelator single-cell-mpx preqc | pixelator adapterqc`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))\n3. Assign a marker (barcode) to each read ([`pixelator single-cell-mpx demux`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))\n4. Error correction, duplicate removal, compute read counts ([`pixelator single-cell-mpx collapse`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))\n5. Compute the components of the graph from the edge list in order to create putative cells ([`pixelator single-cell-mpx graph`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))\n6. Call and annotate cells ([`pixelator single-cell-mpx annotate`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))\n7. Analyze the cells for polarization and colocalization ([`pixelator single-cell-mpx analysis`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))\n8. Generate 3D graph layouts for visualization of cells ([`pixelator single-cell-mpx layout`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))\n9. Report generation ([`pixelator single-cell-mpx report`](https://github.com/PixelgenTechnologies/pixelator))\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Since Nextflow 23.07.0-edge, Nextflow no longer mounts the host's home directory when using Apptainer or Singularity.\n> This causes issues in some dependencies. As a workaround, you can revert to the old behavior by setting the environment variable\n> `NXF_APPTAINER_HOME_MOUNT` or `NXF_SINGULARITY_HOME_MOUNT` to `true` in the machine from which you launch the pipeline.\n\n## Usage\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.\n\nFirst, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows (the exact values you need to input depend on the design and panel you are using):\n\n`samplesheet.csv`:\n\n```csv\nsample,sample_alias,condition,design,panel,fastq_1,fastq_2\nsample1,s1,control,pna-2,proxiome-immuno-155,sample1_R1_001.fastq.gz,sample1_R2_001.fastq.gz\n```\n\nEach row represents a sample and gives the design, a panel file and the input fastq files.\n\nNow, you can run the pipeline using:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run nf-core/pixelator \\\n   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \\\n   --input samplesheet.csv \\\n   --outdir <OUTDIR>\n```\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> This version of the pipeline does not support conda environments, due to issues with upstream dependencies.\n> This means you cannot use the `conda` and `mamba` profiles. Please use `docker` or `singularity` instead.\n> We hope to add support for conda environments in the future.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).\n\nFor more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/pixelator/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/pixelator/parameters).\n\n## Pipeline output\n\nTo see the results of an example test run with a full size dataset refer to the [results](https://nf-co.re/pixelator/results) tab on the nf-core website pipeline page.\nFor more details about the output files and reports, please refer to the\n[output documentation](https://nf-co.re/pixelator/output).\n\n## Credits\n\nnf-core/pixelator was originally written for [Pixelgen Technologies AB](https://www.pixelgen.com/) by:\n\n- Florian De Temmerman\n- Johan Dahlberg\n- Alvaro Martinez Barrio\n\n## Contributions and Support\n\nIf you would like to contribute to this pipeline, please see the [contributing guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nFor further information or help, don't hesitate to get in touch on the [Slack `#pixelator` channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/pixelator) (you can join with [this invite](https://nf-co.re/join/slack)).\n\n## Citations\n\nIf you use nf-core/pixelator for your analysis, please cite it using the following doi: [10.5281/zenodo.10015112](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10015112)\n\nAn extensive list of references for the tools used by the pipeline can be found in the [`CITATIONS.md`](CITATIONS.md) file.\n\nYou can cite the `nf-core` publication as follows:\n\n> **The nf-core framework for community-curated bioinformatics pipelines.**\n>\n> Philip Ewels, Alexander Peltzer, Sven Fillinger, Harshil Patel, Johannes Alneberg, Andreas Wilm, Maxime Ulysse Garcia, Paolo Di Tommaso & Sven Nahnsen.\n>\n> _Nat Biotechnol._ 2020 Feb 13. doi: [10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x).\n\nYou can cite the molecular pixelation technology as follows:\n\n> **Molecular pixelation: spatial proteomics of single cells by sequencing.**\n>\n> Filip Karlsson, Tomasz Kallas, Divya Thiagarajan, Max Karlsson, Maud Schweitzer, Jose Fernandez Navarro, Louise Leijonancker, Sylvain Geny, Erik Pettersson, Jan Rhomberg-Kauert, Ludvig Larsson, Hanna van Ooijen, Stefan Petkov, Marcela Gonz\u00e1lez-Granillo, Jessica Bunz, Johan Dahlberg, Michele Simonetti, Prajakta Sathe, Petter Brodin, Alvaro Martinez Barrio & Simon Fredriksson\n>\n> _Nat Methods._ 2024 May 08. doi: [10.1038/s41592-024-02268-9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-024-02268-9)\n",
