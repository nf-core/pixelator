# nf-core/pixelator: Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [[2.3.0](https://github.com/nf-core/pixelator/releases/tag/2.3.0)] - 2025-12-11

From this release onwards, there will not be a default panel selected, i.e. as a user you
must specify an exact version of the panel you want to use in your samplesheet, e.g. `proxiome-immuno-155-v2`.
The version to use will depend on which kit lot of the Proxiome Immuno kit you are using.
See the [Pixelgen Technologies website](https://www.pixelgen.com/usermanual-dataprocessing/) for
an updated list of which panel version to use with which kit lot.

## [[2.0.0](https://github.com/nf-core/pixelator/releases/tag/2.0.0)] - 2024-05-27

This release is a major update of the nf-core/pixelator pipeline. It brings in support for the
Proximity Network Analysis (PNA) workflow in addition to the Molecular Pixelation (MPX) workflow.
Any run of the pipeline will now run the appropriate workflow depending on which design is specified in the input samplesheet.
